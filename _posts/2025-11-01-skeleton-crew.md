It was a winter night. 
The air was unexpectedly hot, dense with fog.
My eyelids were damp with droplets of water. 
Along with my body, I carried the heavy, sticky air. 
It was like swimming.
A part of me shivered—just a patch.
I wasn’t sure why I could feel it so clearly.
I want it to end—the discomfort, the shivering—but at the same time, I take a strange pleasure in it.

I was commuting by bicycle along Catharijnesingel, a north-south street flanked by a canal on one side and monumental former institutional buildings on the other. 
The canal mirrored the street’s width, lending the area a rare openness. 
But as the street neared the city centre, it dipped beneath a massive mall complex. 
The underpass was dark and wind-funnelled, casting shadows, while the mall and adjacent concert hall enclosed the space in concrete and glass.

I was approaching the busy junction linking the train station and commercial part of the city to the downtown and residential neighbourhoods.
From the slowing motion ahead, I inferred the traffic light had turned red for us.
On the opposite side, cars had stopped, their lights glowing brighter against the fog.
The junction glared with an entangled mesh of bicycle lights, building lights, car lights, and street lamps—all scattered and reflected through the dense fog.
Shades of grey dominated, punctuated by the occasional red stoplight piercing the thick dark blanket.
Foreshortening made distances seem shorter and shapes larger.
Tens, hundreds of bicycles were passing in front of me—silent, spectral, as if summoned by the fog.
The stopped cars illuminated the facelessness of these figures, giving them center stage.
It felt like witnessing a ritual—albeit one no one was aware of.
I imagined myself as a to-be initiate to some secret bicycle cult.
If the traffic light were to malfunction, the silent procession would erupt into chaos—a massacre waiting to happen, held at bay only by a blinking red beacon.
But if this were daylight, I doubt I'd have seen it at all—not the ghost train, not the ritual. 
The shadows and fog conjure the spectacle; in the harsh sun, it would dissolve into mere commute.

What actually was only two minutes of waiting felt much longer.
I felt lonely—because I would never know if there was another person like me, who was fascinated and terrified by that scene.
I felt scared—scared of something larger than myself.
I became a spectator of the scene—and even of myself—as if standing outside myself.
I might have been one of them.
And perhaps, when the light turned for my side of the street, I would have joined the same act.
I wish I could watch it again, to be able to picture it.
There was a strong aesthetic to it.
But it was not beauty.
And yet, I couldn’t stay. I had to move on.
The thought of stepping off, pausing to take a photo, freezing that moment forever, never crossed my mind. 
Besides, a photo would only underline my stillness against all that motion. 
A selfie, though… maybe that would’ve helped. 
I and the faceless. 
Would that ruin the whole point of a selfie, or finally fulfil it?
