What patterns in my thinking reveal my introspection?
When and why do I choose reflection over action?
Was your love of the mountains innate or constructed—and how did you realise which it was?
How has introspection revealed contradictions between your stated origin story and the real causes?


<!-- 
- At this juncture of my life, I find myself assuming a more introspective stance, carefully contemplating the intricate elements that shape my identity. 
- I seek to unravel the choices I consciously made, often necessitating the relinquishment of one path for the embrace of another. 
- As time passed, I came to a realisation that the mountains acted as a catalyst for my personal growth and an undeniable connection with the natural world.

- Through the realm of climbing, I have encountered extraordinary individuals. 
- Among them, A has emerged as my confidante, a steadfast companion whom I trust with my life, both figuratively and literally. 
- Yet, within the tapestry of my climbing journey, I experienced a profound loss when U, a revered figure who held an invaluable place as my role model, tragically perished in a climbing accident. 
- This event forces me to ponder the curious interplay of circumstance and bias. 
- Was it mere coincidence that both A and U shared a passion for mountaineering? 
- Would I have formed equally profound bonds had I embarked on a different pursuit? 
- The essence that resides within these individuals, the essence that resonates so deeply within me, beckons me to delve further into the mysteries of human connection.

- Moreover, I question the origin of my affinity for the mountains. 
- I have long recognized that there existed a deceptive discourse [rather than a genuine disagreement] between how I believed my attraction to the mountains was rooted and the true underlying reasons. 
- In the depths of my mind, I fashioned mountains that would come to shape me in return—an intriguing transformation that has left me captivated. 
- The allure of understanding my own creation persists, threading between the pressures of a commercialised world that commodifies personal identity and a quest to truly know oneself. 
- In this delicate balance, my inner peaks and valleys beckon, inviting me on a  journey of self-discovery. 
- Was it an innate inclination or a deliberate cultivation on my part? 
- Upon reflection, the short answer was predominantly nurture, not nature.

- But of course there is a small part of childhood cosmology too. 
- I would start my story with my early encounters with the mountains. 
- Rize, with its low horizon and perpetually darkened sky, owes its distinctive atmosphere to the majestic Pontic Mountains. 
- These towering peaks, reaching heights of approximately 4,000m, obstruct the southward movement of air masses, enveloping the region in an ambiance that shaped my formative years. 
- Rainfall was a constant companion, and memories of 1986 leave me with the impression that the sun was a rarity. 
- When I reflect on a typical daytime, I can’t help but envision the pale glow of yellow sodium lamps casting a myopic halo on wet and muddy streets. 
- But one rare crystal-clear winter day, I witnessed the entire range glittering in the distance, evoking an impression of the sky finding support from these mountains—a primitive notion that resonates in various mythologies, akin to the concept of the Axis Mundi. 
- But it is nonsense. 
- Because there are many outstanding individuals, who has very strong bonds with the mountains, they started their life in the lowlands.

- Finally, I know I am romanticising it, but indulging in romanticization does no justice. 
- While Romanticism encompasses a fascination with the untamed wilderness and the allure of the 'noble savage,' I find myself positioned as a city person, deeply immersed in the cultural capital of urban life. 
- The ideals of Romanticism, with its emphasis on escaping society and finding solace in nature's untouched beauty, stand in stark contrast in my own experiences and values. 
- Would I live in the mountains, all my life? If I was given an option to have livelihood out in the mountains would I choose? 
- I don't think so, even though I am an earth scientist.

- As I reflect on my connection with the mountains, I am reminded that my perspective is shaped by the complexities of city living and the reliance on cultural capital. 
- This divergence in outlook urges me to question the romanticised notions that often surround my and others' narratives. 
- I want to be honest with myself and towards fellow climbers. 
- This doesn't mean I am sincere in my connection to the mountains. - Wordsworth, highlighting those significant moments in our lives, “spots of time”, that have the power to rejuvenate and uplift us, enhance pleasure and elevate our spirits, even in times of joy, while providing solace and comfort in moments of hardship. 
- For me it has become the idea of the mountains.
